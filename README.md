# Holberton School - Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms** project! In this project, you will dive into the world of sorting algorithms, learning how to implement various sorting techniques and analyze their performance in terms of time and space complexity. Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science, with applications in data organization, searching, and optimization.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and implement a variety of sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and more.
- Analyze the **time complexity** (Big O notation) of different sorting algorithms.
- Compare **space complexity** and memory usage across sorting techniques.
- Recognize which algorithms are stable and when to use certain sorting methods based on the dataset and performance needs.
- Implement sorting algorithms in **C**.
